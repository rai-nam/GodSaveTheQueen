Received pronunciation (RP) was an accent of high prestige in British society as it is associated with the high classes and well-educated. However, nowadays, RP is spoken by 2-3% of the British population. This project aims to preserve RP by analyzing its features through the late Queen Elizabeth II, whose accent was seen as a hallmark of RP. For this study, we have divided our data into three different decades: the 1950s, the 1990s, and the 2010s. This is to examine Her Majesty's pronunciation of vowels and diphthongs throughout different periods of her reign. To extract audio, we used Google Colab (moviepy.editor) and to transcribe the text from audio, we used Open AI Whisper
